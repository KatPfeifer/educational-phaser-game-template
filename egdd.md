# Overview

The limiting reactants simulation will first demonstrate the concept of the limiting reactant by showing charts similar to the PhET simulation where students can add material to a reaction and observe the corresponding products and remaining starting material. For the second part of the simulation, students will be able to create a solution by inputing the number of mLs of each solution they would like to use. They will then fill a cuvette with this solution and determine its absorbance, which can be used to plot a point on a graph and thereby determine the ideal molar ratio.

## Elevator Pitch

This two part simulation will illustrate the idea of limiting reactants and provide students experience with the method of continuous variation.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Students will input the amount of compound into the provided input box for the limiting reactants simulation.
- Students will input their chosen mL amounts of each solution into provided boxes and then click a button to fill a cuvette with the chosen solution. 
- Students will drag a cuvette to the spectrophotometer to determine the absorbance.
- A "plot point" button will allow students to plot their point on the graph corresponding to the method of continuous variation and add the information to the table of values.
- A help button will provide advice or suggestions and will feature FAQ questions in case the students get stuck.

## Learning Domains

- General chemistry
- Limiting reactants
- Method of continuous variation

## Learning Objectives

- Students will be able to define a limiting reactant and the method of continuous variation
- Students will be able to identify the limiting reactant
- Students will be able to identify the ideal molar ratio using the method of continuous variation
- Students will be able to describe how an extensive property, such as absorbance, can be used to determine the ideal molar ratio

## Target Audiences

- general chemistry students

## Target Contexts

- UD Chem103 lab

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Students will be able to define the terms Molar ratios and Mole fractions

# Objects/Entities

- Input boxes or buttons that allow students to select the amount of reactant material
- A reaction selecting mechanism
- Input boxes that where students pick their mLs of solution
- Cuvette -used to gain the absorbance of the solution
- Buttons - to get help, add a point to the graph, or go to a different part of the simulation

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Amount of matter input
  - How it works: Students will either click up/down arrow to increase the amount of starting material or input integer numbers to designate the amount of starting material
- Graph Point Button
  - How it works: When students click this button, the point corresponding to the numbers in the input boxes appears on the method of continuous variation chart. The data also appears in the corresponding table
- Cuvette
  - Students will drag the cuvette to the spectrophotometer
- Reaction Selector
  - How it works: This will allow students to pick from a set of pre-chosen reactions. Their selection will dictate the matter representation (gas, solution, molecules, etc).
    
## Feedback

- When a student inputs their numbers into the input boxes, the charts detailing the products and reactants along with the graph illustrating the mass at the end of the reaction will change accordingly. When the student clicks the "add point to graph" button, the data point corresponding to their numbers will appear on the method of continuous variation graph, adding to any points that the student previously chose to graph.
